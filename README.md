# WeatherApp - Ionic Angular Weather App 
An Ionic Angular weather application with humidity, and average, max., and min. temperature.

## Description
This is the code of an Ionic Angular weather application (created in collaboration with [@marivuolahti](https://github.com/marivuolahti)) that was done using Firebase, Visual Studio Code and Command Prompt/Terminal/Powershell. It was done using the [OpenWeather's API](https://openweathermap.org/).

The application allows the user to submit the name of a city, and receive that city's average, minimum and maximum temperature, as well as its humidity level. 
On top of this, the application has a functional menu and navigation with a login/sing up/continue as guest page, a "my profile" page (with image selection and file upload), and an "about us" and "contact us" pages.

## Status 
The development of this project is complete for the foreseeable future.
