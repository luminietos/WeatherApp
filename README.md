# WeatherApp
An Ionic Angular weather application with humidity, and average, max., and min. temperature.

## Description
This is the code of an Ionic Angular application (created in collaboration with @marivuolahti) that was done using Firebase, Visual Studio Code and Command Prompt/Terminal/Powershell.

The application allows the user to submit the name of a city, and receive that city's average, minimum and maximum temperature, as well as its humidity level. 
On top of this, the application has a functional menu and navigation with a login/sing up/continue as guest page, a "my profile" page (with image selection and file upload), and an "about us" and "contact us" pages.

## Status 
This project is complete.
